[h1] About [/h1]
Pavlov VR is great, but what if your friends don't all have VR?
This is currently a simple client-sided addon with the goal of bringing compatibility between GMOD's built-in TTT gamemode and Catse's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1678408548]VRMod addon[/url] through UI additions and soon through weapon fixes.

[h1] Usage [/h1]
Make sure you and the server both have VRMod, and once you are in-game, type vrmod_start into console. To return to normal, type vrmod_exit (you should probably reconnect just in case). If you want a HUD for your health, timer, and role during the round, check out j2b2's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1937891124]VRMod HUD addon[/url].

[h1] Features [/h1]
[list]
    [*]Client UI on the right hand to indicate player's role at the start of the round
[/list]
It's certainly not much at the moment but I wanted to get everything set up on the workshop for now before I start bringing it all together.

[h1] To-Do [/h1]
[list]
    [*]Buy menu for detectives and traitors
    [*]Client UI for health, timer, and role during round
    [*]Fix weapon names and replace with VR variants
    [*]Pickup using hands
[/list]
