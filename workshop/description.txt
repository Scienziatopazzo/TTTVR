Pavlov VR is great, but what if your friends don't all have VR?

[h1] About [/h1]
This is currently a simple addon with the goal of bringing compatibility between GMOD's built-in TTT gamemode and Catse's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1678408548]VRMod addon[/url] through UI additions, VR weapon replacements, and other fun features.

[h1] Usage [/h1]
Make sure VR users and the server both have Catse's VRMod addon and this addon, and once you are in-game, type vrmod_start into console (It won't start if you are in spectator mode). To return to normal, type vrmod_exit in console.

[h1] Controls [/h1]
The default HTC Vive controls can be found [url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bennyd87708/TTTVR/master/workshop/pictures/controls.jpg]HERE[/url]. You can check the official VRMod addon page to see how the controls adapt for other controllers and can use SteamVR bindings to alter them to your liking.
