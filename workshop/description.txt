Pavlov VR is great, but what if your friends don't all have VR?

[h1] About [/h1]
This is currently a simple addon with the goal of bringing compatibility between GMOD's built-in TTT gamemode and Catse's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1678408548]VRMod addon[/url] through UI additions and soon through VR weapon replacements.

[h1] Usage [/h1]
Make sure VR users and the server both have the VRMod addon and this addon, and once you are in-game, type vrmod_start into console (It won't start if you are in spectator mode). To return to normal, type vrmod_exit in console.

[h1] Controls [/h1]
The default HTC Vive controls can be found [url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bennyd87708/TTTVR/master/workshop/pictures/controls.jpg]HERE[/url]. You can check the official VRMod addon page to adapt them for other controllers. For the time being, the controls aren't editable straight through the addon unless you know what you are doing with lua, but they might be rebindable with SteamVR.
