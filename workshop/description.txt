Pavlov VR is great, but what if your friends don't all have VR?

[h1] About [/h1]
This is currently a simple addon with the goal of bringing compatibility between GMOD's built-in TTT gamemode and Catse's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1678408548]VRMod addon[/url] through UI additions and soon through VR weapon replacements.

[h1] Usage [/h1]
Make sure you and the server both have the VRMod addon and this addon, and once you are in-game, type vrmod_start into console (It won't start if you are in spectator mode). To return to normal, type vrmod_exit in console (sometimes end up in the floor, so you should probably reconnect just in case). If you want a HUD for your health, haste timer, and role during the round, check out j2b2's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1937891124]VRMod HUD addon[/url].
